### [ Corey Schafer Python Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9TUPpGqYTo&list=PL-osiE80TeTt2d9bfVyTiXJA-UTHn6WwU&index=2)

This is a playlist. You don't need to watch every video on the playlist, but if you don't understand a topic in Python, i recommend to check out.

You can enable autogenerated subtitles, these will be mostly correct. Also each video has its own topics so you can easily find what you are looking for.

### [LearnPython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/) 

Go there when you have been introduced to a new topic in Pyton. For example if problem says, 'generators'. Go this link and read generators.

### My Recommendation

My dear lady, your Python learning process will consists of not only practicing, not only reading or not only watching. You will do all of them.

If you watch too much videos but when it comes to practicing, you feel uncomfortable? Then practice

If you practice enough but you are curious that why these things works in such a way? Then go and read somethings about Python

If you have been introduced a topic in Python that you don't know now? Then go and watch videos about that, or search on the internet, or read tutorials

--- 

The thing is you will track your development, and choose a way that it will best for you. Learning is hard, i know that but with enough study, energy and time, you will enter this beautiful coding world.
