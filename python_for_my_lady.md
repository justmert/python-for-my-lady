### odd or even 
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user

----

### list less than ten

Take a list, say for example this one:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

After that, ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.

---

### divisors

Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. (If you don’t know what a divisor is, it is a number that divides evenly into another number. For example, 13 is a divisor of 26 because 26 / 13 has no remainder.)

---

### palindrome or not

Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.). For example 'solos'

---

### rock paper scissors

Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game)

Remember the rules:


* Rock beats scissors

* Scissors beats paper

* Paper beats rock


---

### reverse word order

Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order. For example, say I type the string:

`My name is Michele`

Then I would see the string:

`Michele is name My`

shown back to me.

---

### max of three

Implement a function that takes as input three variables, and returns the largest of the three

---

### tic tac toe 

Make a two-player Tic Tac Toe game!

---

### hangman 

Make a hangman game! 

In the game of Hangman, the player only has 6 incorrect guesses (head, body, 2 legs, and 2 arms) before they lose the game.

We will load a random word list and picked a word from it. After that, we will write the logic for guessing the letter and displaying that information to the user.

You can add,

* Only let the user guess 6 times, and tell the user how many guessesthey have left.
* Keep track of the letters the user guessed. If the user guesses aletter they already guessed, don’t penalize them - let them guess again.
